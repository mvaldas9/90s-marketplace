# Interview task for the position at CGtrader

Check [TASK.md](./TASK.md) for details about the task.

## My Plan

Even though the task is mostly focused on cart implementation I am going to use this as a chance to learn and experiment with react and implement more features than required.

- ~~Initial clean up~~ (30min)
- ~~Separate concerns, better file structure~~ (30min)
- ~~Implement a more robust router solution~~ (30min)
- ~~Implement state managment solution~~ (1h)
- ~~Cart functionality~~(2h)
- Tests
