# Interview task for the position at CGtrader

Check [TASK.md](./TASK.md) for details about the task.

## My Plan

Even though the task is mostly focused on cart implementation I am going to use this as a chance to learn and experiment with react and implement more features than required like a router and redux.

- ~~Initial clean up~~ (30min)
- ~~Separate concerns, better file structure, swag styles~~ (1h)
- ~~Implement router~~ (30min)
- ~~Implement redux~~ (1h)
- ~~Cart functionality~~(2h)
- ~~Tests~~(2h)
